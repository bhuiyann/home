		<h1> A Brief History On Hip Hop And R&amp;B </h1>
		<img src="/images/HistoryPagePic.jpg" alt="Boombox">
		<p> 
		Hip Hop and R&amp;B are usually categorized together as one music genre because of the crossovers and similarities between the two.
		Hip Hop started off as an art movement in South Bronx and the music was just an outlet for the creativity of the people within the movement.
		Hip Hop was part of the new wave of electronically based music and relied heavily on casette tapes and vinyls as it was heavily played in clubs and on the streets.
		Hip Hop can be divided in to 4 different eras. First is the 80&apos;s, the 80&apos;s is a pinacle moment in rap because it marked one of the first times it was in the limelight of North American mainstream media.
		Hip Hop was in the mainstream media because of the rappers who were speaking out against the police brutality that was concerning minorities.
		Next is the 90's era, this was the era that marked Rap's influence on the music industry as producers of that era pioneered the art of sampling.
		This was also the era of some of the most game changing musical rivalries we have ever seen &lpar;eg. Biggie and Tupac&rpar;. Next we have the early 2000s. This era is when Hip Hop was on it's way too taking over the mainstream media.
		This was evident when looking at the chart topping albums made by Kanye West, Jay Z, Eminem and 50 Cent. Then we have the 2010&apos;s, this is the era where rap officially became the most popular music genre in North America.
		According to Nielsen Ratings Hip Hop has passed Rock as the most listened to, genre in music. The 2010&apos;s has had many genre altering events such as the extreme increase in Hip Hop and R&amp;B and also the shift in lyrics.
		R&amp;B  was a biproduct of the blues craze that started in the early 20th century and it has seen many changes since then.
		Although the roots of R&amp;B can be traced back to the 1930&apos;s and 1940&apos; the real history of Modern R&amp;B starts in the 1990&apos;s.
		One of the important events in R&amp;B during the 1990s was the Mariah Carrey and Boyz II Men Single &ldquo;One Sweet Day&rdquo;, which was a chart topping single. 
		Another important event in the 90s was the heavy incorporation of soul music. Next, we have the early 2000s where R&amp;B changed from romantic music to more party music.
		And finally, we have present day R&amp;B which has steered away from party music and has reverted back to the lyrical and romantic music in the same style as the 90s.
